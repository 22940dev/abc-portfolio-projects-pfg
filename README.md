  Scripting tool, Shortcuts.

  discord added official ||spoilers|| a month after its release.
- [interpunctbot](https://gitlab.com/pfgitlab/interpunctbot) - a bot that does a few
  things like adding spaces to channel names and letting mods rank people with emojis.

# other things
- [atom markdown editor](https://github.com/pfgithub/atom-markdown-editor) - my highly
  configurable atom user stylesheet with many settings for improving markdown editing
  in atom. 
- [electron-music-player](electron-music-player) - a simple, lightweight\* music player
  that shows lyrics of the current song (\* as lightweight as an electron project can be,
  which is not very)
- [sitepages](sitepages) - quickly hacked together interfaces to quickly hacked together
  javascript code.
