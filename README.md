- [leaderboard history](https://pfg.pw/travelersleaderboard/player) - a viewer for the full history of the travelers leaderboard
- [travelersapi](https://github.com/pfgithub/travelersapi) - connect to thetravelers.online from node. this is what I used to make [my bot](https://github.com/pfgithub/thetravelers-bot)

- [events](https://pfg.pw/travelersevents/travel-travel.html) - explore the events I have visited. the [wiki](https://thetravelers.miraheze.org/wiki/Locations) is probably more useful than this
- [wikigen](https://github.com/pfgithub/travelers-wikigen) - generate initial item descriptions for the [wiki](https://thetravelers.miraheze.org/wiki/Locations)

- [one-health](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/one-health) - a mod made by request
  that makes all entities start at one hp so you have to repair them. I have never
  actually used this mod in a playthrough and don't plan to, it sounds terrible.
- [liquid science](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/liquid-science) - turns science
  into a liquid. it's pretty bad, I have never used this in a real playthrough
- (planned) a mod that allows you to deposit science packs and then research any
  science immediately so you don't have to constantly be deciding what to research
  next and can actually use the new items you get from research.
